## What this does

This file is designed to trigger a workflow without requiring manual interaction with GitHub or local development.

When this file is updated, it should trigger a workflow that:
1. Creates the test output directory
2. Runs a simple mock test
3. Uploads the results as an artifact

This avoids the limitations of GitHub Actions with PR-related workflows and allows for direct testing.
