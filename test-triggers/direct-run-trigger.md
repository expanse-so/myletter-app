# Direct Test Trigger

This file triggers a direct test execution.

Timestamp: 2025-03-28T19:45:30Z (updated to trigger workflow)

## What this does

This file is designed to trigger a workflow without requiring manual interaction with GitHub or local development.

When this file is updated, it should trigger a workflow that:
1. Creates the test output directory
2. Runs a simple mock test
3. Uploads the results as an artifact
4. Commits the results back to the repository

This avoids the limitations of GitHub Actions with PR-related workflows and allows for direct testing without:
- Manually going to GitHub UI
- Pulling code locally
- Dealing with token permissions for PRs

The workflow should start immediately after this change is pushed.
