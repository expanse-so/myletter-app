This workflow will:
1. Run all tests
2. Generate detailed test results in machine-readable JSON
3. Create a human-readable summary in Markdown
4. Commit the results back to the repository
5. The AI can then read these results directly using GitHub tools

The results will be automatically committed to `test-results/` in the repository, allowing the AI to analyze them without human intervention - aligning with the Expanse philosophy of removing humans from implementation loops.
