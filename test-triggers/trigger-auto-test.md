## Latest Test Run Trigger
Timestamp: 2025-03-28T21:19:30Z  

This workflow will now run with the following real tests:
1. ModelSelector.test.js
2. TipTapEditor.test.js
3. CursorChatInterface.test.js
4. SplitViewLayout.test.js
5. utils.test.js (API)

All tests have been properly configured with:
- jest.config.js
- jest.setup.js
- Updated package.json with test dependencies
- API implementation in utils/api.ts

This will provide real test results that the AI can read directly without human intervention, aligning with the Expanse philosophy of removing humans from implementation loops.
