```

### 2. GitHub API
```bash
curl -X POST \
  -H "Accept: application/vnd.github+json" \
  -H "Authorization: token YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN" \
  https://api.github.com/repos/expanse-so/myletter-app/actions/workflows/manual-test-runner.yml/dispatches \
  -d '{"ref":"feature/testing-implementation"}'
```

NOTE: We've made several critical test configuration updates:

1. Added proper TypeScript configuration (tsconfig.json)
2. Added Jest configuration (jest.config.js)
3. Added Jest setup with global mocks (jest.setup.js)
4. Updated the workflow to ensure it uses the feature branch
5. Added detailed error reporting

These changes should help diagnose and fix the test failures.
