```

curl -X POST \
  -H "Accept: application/vnd.github+json" \
  -H "Authorization: token YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN" \
  https://api.github.com/repos/expanse-so/myletter-app/actions/workflows/manual-test-runner.yml/dispatches \
  -d '{"ref":"feature/testing-implementation"}'
```

NOTE: This file has been modified to trigger test runs after fixing component implementations. The fixes include:

1. Fixed ModelSelector to match test expectations
2. Updated TipTapEditor with required button titles and missing buttons
3. Fixed CursorChatInterface to use proper message format and handlers
4. Added utils/api.ts implementation
5. Updated SplitViewLayout to use correct test IDs and format

These changes should address the test failures we were seeing.
