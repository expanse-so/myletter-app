# Simple Test Trigger

This file triggers the simple-test.yml workflow, which is a minimal test runner for diagnostic purposes.

## Purpose
This simplified workflow focuses on just running the tests without complex result processing or dependencies. It helps diagnose issues with the main testing workflow.

## Trigger Timestamp
2025-03-28T21:36:30Z

## Expected Outcome
- Basic test execution
- Creation of a simple result file
- Committing that file back to the repository

This approach should help us identify whether the issue is with the test execution itself or with the more complex result processing in the main workflow.
