# Basic Test Trigger

This file triggers the basic test workflow that doesn't use the problematic upload-artifact action.

## How This Works

This workflow is simpler and more reliable:

1. It doesn't use the problematic `actions/upload-artifact@v3` action
2. It directly commits test results to the repository
3. It runs a basic set of mock tests (the same 39 tests)
4. No complicated dependencies or actions required

Since we're having issues with the artifact upload actions, this approach is more reliable and gives us exactly what we need: test results committed directly to the repository.

Simply update this file anytime you want to run tests.
