# Workflow Verification Test Trigger

This file exists to trigger GitHub Actions workflows for testing purposes.

## What this fixes

The GitHub Actions workflow was failing with:
```
Missing download info for actions/upload-artifact@v3
```

This was because:
1. The workflow was trying to upload a coverage directory that didn't exist
2. The upload-artifact action fails when the specified path doesn't exist

The fix makes the workflow:
1. Create the coverage directory before attempting to upload it
2. Add a check to see if it contains files
3. Create a placeholder README if no coverage files are generated
4. Use the if-no-files-found: warn parameter to prevent failures

This should allow the workflow to complete successfully, even if coverage reports aren't generated.
