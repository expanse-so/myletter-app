# Direct API Test Trigger

This file triggers the direct-api-test.yml workflow, which outputs test results directly to the GitHub Actions logs where they can be accessed via the API - no artifacts or commits required.

## Purpose
This approach aligns with the Expanse architecture vision by making test results directly accessible to AI systems without requiring human intervention. The results are written directly to the logs which can be read through the GitHub API.

## Trigger Timestamp
2025-03-28T21:44:00Z

## Expected Outcome
- Tests run and output results directly in the logs
- Tests results are also formatted as structured JSON
- Results are accessible via GitHub's API without human interaction
- AI can read the test results programmatically without downloading artifacts

## Accessing Results
1. Get workflow run ID from GitHub API
2. Fetch logs directly from the API
3. Parse out the test results

This provides a fully automated solution with no human intervention required - exactly as the Expanse architecture envisions.
