## Test Implementation Details

### Testing Tools Used
- Jest for test framework
- React Testing Library for component testing
- Mock implementations for external dependencies
- Custom direct test runner for immediate results

### Testing Approach
- Component testing for UI elements
- Mock implementations for complex dependencies
- Full coverage of component props and behaviors
- Testing of user interactions and event handling

### Key Test Assertions
- Component rendering with various props
- User interaction handling
- State changes in response to events
- Component integration points
- Error handling and edge cases

## Next Steps
Based on these successful test results, we recommend:

1. Continue expanding test coverage to additional components
2. Add integration tests for component interactions
3. Implement end-to-end tests for critical user flows
4. Set up continuous monitoring of test coverage metrics
