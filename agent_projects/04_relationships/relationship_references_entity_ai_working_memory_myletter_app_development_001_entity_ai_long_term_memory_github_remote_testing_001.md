# Relationship: Working Memory References GitHub Remote Testing Framework

## Context
This relationship documents how the working memory for the MyLetter app development project incorporates knowledge from the long-term memory about the GitHub remote testing framework. The working memory contains project status and current focus areas, while the long-term memory contains detailed implementation knowledge about the remote testing approach.

## Relationship Significance
The relationship is significant because:

1. The GitHub remote testing framework is a key component of the development workflow
2. The working memory uses this knowledge to inform current development decisions
3. The testing approach affects multiple aspects of the project recorded in working memory
4. Future development strategies will build upon this testing approach

## Shared Concepts
- GitHub-based development workflow
- Test-driven development methodologies
- Vitest configuration and implementation
- Build process optimization
- Deployment best practices

## Integration Points
- Testing strategy mentioned in working memory refers to detailed implementation in long-term memory
- Lessons learned in working memory derive from experiences documented in long-term memory
- Technical considerations in working memory relate to testing framework implementation
- Future improvements in working memory will leverage testing framework capabilities

## Usage Guidance
When working with the MyLetter app development, reference this relationship to:
1. Understand how testing is integrated into the development workflow
2. Apply consistent testing practices based on established patterns
3. Troubleshoot build and deployment issues related to testing
4. Extend the testing framework for new features
5. Maintain consistency in testing approach across the project
